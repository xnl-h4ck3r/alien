# alien
Your favourite chest/terminal bursting buddy! 

This is one of the first bash tools I wrote when I started learning Linux a few years ago. Who doesn't want a cute alien bursting out their terminal?!
If you think Alien is scary, then you should see the code! Honestly, don't judge me on it, I wrote it a long time ago... I'm just putting it up here for entertainment value and posterity so don't expect it to work properly. It just displays a message that you pass to it. Why not add it to the end of your recpon scripts??

## Installing
Just copy the `alien` file and put it in `~/.local/bin`

## Running
Examples:
`alien Your recon has finished!`
`echo "Your recon has finished!" | alien`
